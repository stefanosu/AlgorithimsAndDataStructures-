# AlgorithmsAndDataStructures

Going through Udemy Course on JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Master Class by Colt Steele: 


### Big O Notation: 
   #####  Gives a measurement of the efficiency of an algorithm usually the time or space complexity of an algorithm. How much time it takes to excute the code and how much memory or space the code takes up.  


### Frequency Pattern: 
   ##### This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values.This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings. 
  
  
  #### Coding Exercise 1: Frequency Counter - validAnagram. 
  
  
### Multiple Pointers Pattern: 
   ##### This pattern is creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the begininning, middle or end based on certain conditions. Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity. 


  #### Coding Exercise 2: Multiple Pointers - countUniqueValues. 


  ### Sliding Window Pattern: 
   ##### This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases, or closes (and a new window is created) very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array /string.
  
  
  #### Coding Exercise 3: Sliding Window - maxSubArraySum. 


### Recursion:  
   #####  Is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem (as opposed to iteration).

### Searching Algorithms: 
   #### Linear Search - is a process that checks every element in the list sequentially until the desired element is found. The computational complexity for linear search is O(n) 
   
   #### Binary Search - is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.
